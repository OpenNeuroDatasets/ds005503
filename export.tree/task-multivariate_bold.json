    "TaskName": "Multivariate RNC controlling images experiment",
    "TaskDescription": "While maintaining central fixation, participants were presented with the V1 vs. V4 multivariate RNC controlling images. Each run lasted 484 seconds (or 484 TRs, since the TRs were of length 1 second), and consisted of 121 trials: 100 stimulus trials where multivariate RNC controlling images were presented, 5 catch trials and 16 blank trials. The whole scan session consisted of 12 runs (1200 stimulus trials in total). We controlled stimulus presentation using the code at: https://github.com/gifale95/RNC/06_in_vivo_validation/01_experimental_paradigm/multivariate_rnc_experiment"
